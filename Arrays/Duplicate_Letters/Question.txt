Duplicate Letters

You are given with an array which contains n+1 letters which will contain ‘a’ to nth alphabet. 
One of the letters in the range will be repeated. Your task is to return the repeated letter.

Constrains : 

1 <= n <= pow(10,5)
arr.size == n+1
‘a’ <= arr[i] <= nth alphabet

Follow up : 
1. Can you solve this question by using constant space 
2. Can you solve this question by using O(N) time complexity and constant space

( Assume that using arr of size 26 is not considered as constant space )

Sample Test Cases
-----------------

1.	Input -
	arr = [ ‘c’ , ’b’ , ‘a’ , ‘a’ ]

	Output -
	‘a’

2.	Input -
	arr = [ ‘d’ , ‘d’ , ’b’ , ‘a’ , ‘c’ ]

	Output -
	‘d’
